## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Timer App Learnings:

**State Management**: Switched from remember to delegate like a ✨ magician ✨. Code is cleaner, clearer, and more organized !

**LaunchedEffect**: Mastered time-based actions ! This secret tool keeps my timer ticking flawlessly ⏱️.

**Canvas Magic**: Unlocked the secrets of Canvas ! Now I can draw arcs, circles, and even handles like a rockstar !

**Arc Angles**: Cracked the code ! Figured out how to set startAngle and sweepAngle perfectly for those awesome inActive and Active arcs – the core of the timer !

**Handle Positioning**: Geometry to the rescue ! Used math (don't run away! ‍♀️‍♂️) to calculate the perfect handle placement, making it move like a charm ✨!
